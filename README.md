      Oops! Looks like there's an issue with your form validation/submission.

[] Reviewer Comments:

Your focus state indicators are working beautifully. So are your error messages and icons. But only on the initial submission. When the user submits an empty form all icons and messages are showing up as expected, but if they then fix half of them and resubmit, the errors are still present instead of being revalidated to become checkmarks. You'll want to make sure to update the icons and remove the warnings when a field is valid upon submission.
